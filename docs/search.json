    "section": "",
    "text": "Translating statistics into a simple and informative narrative for the public can be particularly challenging for statisticians at an early stage in their career. As an advocacy group for early-career statisticians, our panel session aims to help recent graduates and early-career statisticians, especially those who are interested in collaborative research in policy fields, learn essential skills in communicating statistics with policy stakeholders as well as strategies of identifying collaboration opportunities and maintaining good collaboration in policy fields. We hope this session can also motivate early career statisticians to engage in collaborative work within policy fields and use scientific findings from their research to help improve policy decision making.\nInformative and translational statistics play crucial roles in shaping effective public policy by providing valuable insights, evidence-based decision-making, and clear communication to policymakers and the public. Informative statistics involves the analysis and interpretation of data to extract meaningful insights. Translational statistics involves transforming complex statistical findings into actionable insights that are easily understandable by policymakers, stakeholders, and the general public. These two aspects of statistics help bridge the gap between data analysis and the formulation of policies that can address societal challenges and promote the well-being of communities thus countering misinformation and its spread. To accomplish such objectives, statisticians play a crucial role in extracting insightful findings from data and conveying them for the comprehension of both policy makers and the general public. However, these responsibilities can be particularly challenging for statisticians in the early stages of their career."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The transition from graduate school to navigate the unknowns of the job market is challenging for every new statistician. Proper training, efficient networking, and building a professional profile are some of the early initiatives to prepare graduate students for this change. Statisticians are trained in modeling and data analysis; however, the real-world job market requires skills beyond technical knowledge, including communication, presentation, leadership, and collaborative skills, as well as pitching one’s ideas and goals, and being able to advocate for oneself. As a group of emerging statisticians, CENS would like to fill this gap and invite academia and industry statisticians to discuss the unique challenges that early-career statisticians might face in a new work environment and how to deal with them.\nThis session aims to provide valuable guidance and insights to empower students on their career journey. With a special focus on the preparation of diversity statements as well as diverse work environment, this session recognizes the importance of fostering inclusivity and diversity in the statistics and biostatistics field. Attendees will gain practical strategies and tools to effectively communicate their experiences, perspectives, and commitment to diversity. By addressing the unique challenges faced by underrepresented groups, this session aims to create a supportive environment that promotes equity and equal opportunities.\nThrough interactive discussions and real-life examples, attendees will explore diverse career pathways, learn about industry expectations, and acquire skills to effectively market themselves. Our panel includes both academic and industry statisticians who have served on hiring committees. Their valuable insights and mentoring guidance will be useful for newly emerging statisticians for navigating the job market successfully.\nTopics to be discussed include, but are not limited to, crafting an effective diversity statement, navigating funding opportunities, exploring the similarities and differences between industry and academia jobs, perspectives of recruiters or hiring committees, what questions should be prepared in an interview, and how to prepare for an interview. Panelists will share their experiences and provide guidance. We anticipate attendees will leave this session equipped with tools to succeed in their initial job search and be better informed about the opportunities to achieve their career goals."
