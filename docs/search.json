    "text": "Translating statistics into a simple and informative narrative for the public can be particularly challenging for statisticians at an early stage in their career. As an advocacy group for early-career statisticians, our panel session aims to help recent graduates and early-career statisticians, especially those who are interested in collaborative research in policy fields, learn essential skills in communicating statistics with policy stakeholders as well as strategies of identifying collaboration opportunities and maintaining good collaboration in policy fields. We hope this session can also motivate early career statisticians to engage in collaborative work within policy fields and use scientific findings from their research to help improve policy decision making.\nInformative and translational statistics play crucial roles in shaping effective public policy by providing valuable insights, evidence-based decision-making, and clear communication to policymakers and the public. Informative statistics involves the analysis and interpretation of data to extract meaningful insights. Translational statistics involves transforming complex statistical findings into actionable insights that are easily understandable by policymakers, stakeholders, and the general public. These two aspects of statistics help bridge the gap between data analysis and the formulation of policies that can address societal challenges and promote the well-being of communities thus countering misinformation and its spread. To accomplish such objectives, statisticians play a crucial role in extracting insightful findings from data and conveying them for the comprehension of both policy makers and the general public. However, these responsibilities can be particularly challenging for statisticians in the early stages of their career."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The transition from graduate school to navigate the unknowns of the job market is challenging for every new statistician. Proper training, efficient networking, and building a professional profile are some of the early initiatives to prepare graduate students for this change. Statisticians are trained in modeling and data analysis; however, the real-world job market requires skills beyond technical knowledge, including communication, presentation, leadership, and collaborative skills, as well as pitching one’s ideas and goals, and being able to advocate for oneself. As a group of emerging statisticians, CENS would like to fill this gap and invite academia and industry statisticians to discuss the unique challenges that early-career statisticians might face in a new work environment and how to deal with them.\nThis session aims to provide valuable guidance and insights to empower students on their career journey. With a special focus on the preparation of diversity statements as well as diverse work environment, this session recognizes the importance of fostering inclusivity and diversity in the statistics and biostatistics field. Attendees will gain practical strategies and tools to effectively communicate their experiences, perspectives, and commitment to diversity. By addressing the unique challenges faced by underrepresented groups, this session aims to create a supportive environment that promotes equity and equal opportunities.\nThrough interactive discussions and real-life examples, attendees will explore diverse career pathways, learn about industry expectations, and acquire skills to effectively market themselves. Our panel includes both academic and industry statisticians who have served on hiring committees. Their valuable insights and mentoring guidance will be useful for newly emerging statisticians for navigating the job market successfully.\nTopics to be discussed include, but are not limited to, crafting an effective diversity statement, navigating funding opportunities, exploring the similarities and differences between industry and academia jobs, perspectives of recruiters or hiring committees, what questions should be prepared in an interview, and how to prepare for an interview. Panelists will share their experiences and provide guidance. We anticipate attendees will leave this session equipped with tools to succeed in their initial job search and be better informed about the opportunities to achieve their career goals."

    "text": "In today’s rapidly evolving data-driven world, the skills of statisticians extend far beyond traditional academic research. From influencing policy decisions in government agencies to driving innovation at technology companies, the range of opportunities for statisticians is expanding quickly. Despite the abundance of opportunities, their variety and scope are not always well communicated to graduate students and early-career statisticians, who often have limited exposure beyond academic settings at this point in their careers. As an advocacy group for early-career statisticians, our panel session is designed to illuminate the diverse career opportunities available in various sectors beyond traditional academic pathways. We hope this session can motivate early career statisticians to explore a wide array of career options aligned with their interests and understand how to navigate these varied roles. By showcasing insights from professionals across different industries, we aim to bridge the gap between academic training and the dynamic, multifaceted career landscape available outside of academia.\nStatisticians are integral to various sectors, playing pivotal roles in extracting valuable insights from data, conveying these findings to relevant stakeholders, making critical decisions, and even building data-driven products. Despite the burgeoning opportunities, the distinctions between these roles can be unclear, and the path to these positions often diverges significantly from traditional academic trajectories. This session aims to explore the diverse career paths available to statisticians beyond academia, offering guidance and inspiration for those seeking to make meaningful contributions in non-academic fields.\nTo achieve our session goals, we will feature a diverse panel of six statisticians from various career stages with experience in government, non-profits, technology, sports, academia, and pharmaceuticals. Each panelist will share their unique experiences and insights from their respective career paths and current positions. This discussion will highlight the different ways that statistics are applied across these industries and provide practical advice on the skills needed for each sector.\nAs session organizers, we represent a group of emerging and new statisticians from the Council for Emerging and New Statisticians (CENS) within ENAR (the Eastern North American Region of the International Biometrics Society), and this session aligns with the goals of our group to support emerging statisticians in their career journeys. We have previously organized many invited panel sessions, including annually at ENAR (since 2016) and JSM (since 2020) conferences.\nThe Chair will begin the session by briefly introducing CENS and its goals for helping ENAR better serve the needs of students and recent graduates. Next, panelists will each give a short introduction about their background, interests, and experiences exploring different career pathways. The chair will then moderate a discussion on the topics listed above, including why the panelist chose their path, what they enjoy about their work, what they find challenging, advice they have for new statisticians, skills needed for their job, and other audience-driven topics of interest. The majority of the session will consist of open Q&A during which time our speakers can answer any questions attendees may have."

As graduate students and early-career professionals build up their portfolios, they will inevitably need to work with a colleague whose training differs from their own. This situation can often be challenging due to potential misalignments in project expectations, domain vocabulary, and end goals. As a group of emerging statisticians, CENS would like to invite statisticians and scientists at various career stages to discuss the “need-to-knows” of collaboration from diverse perspectives and successful interdisciplinary research. This topic will be of interest to all statisticians new to collaboration, and the different perspectives from the diverse backgrounds of our panelists reflect the 2025 ENAR meeting theme of “ENAR is Interdisciplinary”.\nThis session aims to increase transparency in the collaborative process between scientists and statisticians. By providing attendees with perspectives from both scientists and statisticians, from both early-career and established researchers, this session improves understanding of the inner workings of scientific collaboration. With a special focus on highlighting early-career needs and identifying common pitfalls, attendees will gain valuable insights into effective communication in scientific collaboration and navigating interdisciplinary projects."

Rooms can fill up quickly, talks sometimes run over, or you might simply change your mind once you see what’s happening nearby. There are typically 15 minutes between sessions, so preparing a plan beforehand can help during conference day.\nThe ENAR conference app makes it easy to build your personal schedule and get reminders throughout the day. Download it before you arrive!"
