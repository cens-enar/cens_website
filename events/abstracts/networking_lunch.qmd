title: CENS Networking Lunch
---

CENS will organize lunches for groups of attendees who share similar interests. The goal is to help attendees meet and network with each other. Although CENS will help to coordinate lunch at local restaurants, please note that lunch is at your own expense and CENS will not be able to cater to special dietary requirements. Closer to the meeting time, CENS will email all attendees interested in this networking event to request information to set up the groups and the lunch reservations.

Participants meet at the CENS table before walking with their assigned group to a nearby restaurant for networking and lunch! Participation is open to all meeting attendees. If you would like to participate, please select the CENS lunch option on the registration form or email CENS at enar.cens\@gmail.com.
